\section*{Course Policies}

\subsection*{During Class}

\footnotesize{ Please be mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet and everyone has different levels of concerns. This is why UMBC/USG policies constitutes a common denominator that I expect everyone to follow in my classes. I ask everyone to be proactive about this and do their fair share in order to keep our community safe and protected. Moreover if you have any concerns about this topic please don't hesitate to share it with me immediately.}

\footnotesize{I understand that the electronic recording of notes will be important for class and so computers will be allowed in class. Please refrain from using computers for anything but activities related to the class. Phones are prohibited as they are rarely useful for anything in the course. Eating and drinking are allowed in class but please refrain from it affecting the course. Try not to eat your lunch in class as the classes are typically active.}

\subsection*{Policies on Incomplete Grades and Late Assignments}
Late/incomplete assignments will be accepted if an extension has been agreed to in advance. Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification or documentation.
\newline 
Incomplete grades are granted only for extenuating circumstances and your request is made before the last week of class.

\section*{Institutional Policies}
