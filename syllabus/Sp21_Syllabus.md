__Course Description__

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, and cleaning; data storage in relational and non-relational stores; data analysis using supervised and unsupervised learning using Python; data visualization; and scaling up for Big Data.

__Learning Objectives__

Upon completion, students will understand:

•   Classify Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, strings, and dataframes.

•   Produce scatter plots, histograms, and bar graphs (data visualization).

•   Transform raw data into useful information (data characterization).

•   Identify anomalous data and outliers.

•   Employ common Python modules such as random and pandas.

•   Use common data formats such as CSV, JSON, XML.

__Covid_19__

Covid-19
Due to the global pandemic, our classes will be held remotely this semester. 
Please see [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWWGAR8qEzKYr7qaVHoEhvO6lyXIyn6M3M7EFZPJQgA/edit?usp=sharing) for UMBC Policies and Resources during COVID-19.


__Github Repository__

I will use [this Github Repository](https://github.com/mguner/DATA601_SP21) as our course webpage. You can check this page regulary for the updates and important information related to the course.


Please make sure you check [UMBC Data Science - Setup](https://github.com/UMBC-Data-Science/Welcome) and come prepared before the first lecture.

__Textbook__

• "Data Wrangling with Python: Tips and Tools to Make Your Life Easier", first edition by Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul. O'Reilly Media (Primary)

• ["Python Data Science Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. O'Reilly Media

• "Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step-by-step" by Brian Godsey. Manning Publications (Optional)

__Course Format and Assignments__

Students will complete assigned homework, readings, quizzes. This course incorporates a variety of hands-on labs and practical exercises to engage students and prepare them for challenges they may encounter in the workplace.

Students will occasionally present their solutions to homework assignments in class.

The final project will provide students opportunity to showcase what they have learned in a format similar to what they will encounter in a professional work setting. 

__Grading Criteria__

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. Missed lectures result in an attendance score of zero for that lecture. Students will occasionally present results of analysis to the entire class. Student participation in online classes is expected; __watching recorded lectures outside of class does not count towards attendance!__.

Assignments and quizzes are graded on a 10 point scale. For the homework due dates please check the weekly schedule below. Also there will be pop quizes. Not all assignments and quizzes will be counted towards the course grade. Which assignments are counted for the course are randomly selected; these selections are not disclosed to students. Everyone gets the same random selection of assignments. All assignments are scored.

UMBC provides a range of writing assistance, which can be found in the following:

•   The Writing Center: http://lrc.umbc.edu/tutor/writing-center/ 

•   Research Guides & Tutorials: http://lib.guides.umbc.edu/tutorial 

Failure to follow guidelines for each assignment, including the required format, style, length, and submission may result in at least one-letter-grade reduction on the assignment depending on the type or number of transgressions.

__Late Assignments__

__NO__ Late/incomplete assignments will be accepted! Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification or documentation.  

Incomplete grades are granted only for extenuating circumstances and your request is made before the last week of class.

__Academic Integrity__

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty.  Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping other to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong.  Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to failure, suspension or dismissal.  

Refer to the UMBC policy on Academic Integrity: http://catalog.umbc.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=879#academic-integrity.
